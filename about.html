<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey, I’m David Akwari — an IT student and big football fan. I built this site for my web development class to highlight Ballon d’Or winners and the seasons that made them stand out.</p>

<p>When I’m not working on tech stuff, I’m usually watching games, checking out highlights, or trying to learn new things in web design. This project was a cool way to mix both — football and coding — and get some hands-on practice with HTML and CSS.</p>
